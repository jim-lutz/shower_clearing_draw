notes on shower clearing draw analysis
2017-11-27

Start with Cal_Events.accdb, since I have it.
Turn it into csv files 
./access2csv.sh '/home/jiml/HotWaterResearch/projects/CECHWT24/hot water calcs/draw patterns/Aquacraft/Cal_Events.accdb'

Trying RODBC first. had to 
  $ sudo apt-get install unixodbc unixodbc-dev
first.
Had to chmod +777 a directory to get the installation to work
Can't find an open-source driver for .accdb files.

Downloaded access2csv.jar from https://github.com/AccelerationNet/access2csv/releases

Used access2csv.jar directly.
