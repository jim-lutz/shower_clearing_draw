flowchart of files in shower clearing draw analysis

get_accdb_data.R
  # script get the access database tables from
  calls:    access2csv.jar
  input:    Cal_Events.accdb
  output:   DT_events.RData
  
calc_clearing_draw.R
  # script calculate the clearing draw for showers
  input:  DT_events.RData

    After looking at the charts of from this and thinking about it a bit
    realised that can't use Aquacraft's event records. The mode is just
    the flow rate that shows up in the most intervals in the event. If flow
    rate during the shower varies a little bit, mode won't show the whole 
    duration of the shower. 

    Went back to recover the Aquacraft Seattle and EBMUD conservation studies 
    where I do have the flow databases.

get_shower_class.R
    # script to find class number for USETYPE = SHOWER from different Aquacraft datafiles
    input: ./data/Aquacraft/EBMUD/EBMUD Retrofit Database.mdb

        doesn't appear class has a unique correspondence to SHOWER.
        it's probably some temporary variable in Aquacraft's analysis. 

get_data_table.R
    # script to test a function to get data tables from different Aquacraft datafiles
    input:  ./data/Aquacraft/EBMUD/EBMUD Retrofit Database.mdb
    
        this was successful. Used mdb-export to export tables to csv file then read the csv file.

get_showers.R
    # script to get shower data from all the 'LOGGING DATA '{1|2|3}{|Hot Water} tables
    input:  ./data/Aquacraft/EBMUD/EBMUD Retrofit Database.mdb
            ./data/Aquacraft/Seattle/Seattle end use data.mdb
    output: ./data/DT_showers.RData
