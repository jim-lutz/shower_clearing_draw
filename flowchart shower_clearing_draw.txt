flowchart of files in shower clearing draw analysis

After looking at the charts of from this and thinking about it a bit
realised that can't use Aquacraft's event records. The mode is just
the flow rate that shows up in the most intervals in the event. If flow
rate during the shower varies a little bit, mode won't show the whole 
duration of the shower. 

Went back to recover the Aquacraft Seattle and EBMUD conservation studies 
where I do have the flow databases.
